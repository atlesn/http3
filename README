This is a VERY simple HTTP/3 client.

To change server and endpoints, modify the code in wrap.c .

As-is, the code will make one GET and one POST request to
127.0.0.1 port 4433 to endpoint "/README.rst" after which
the connection will be kept open by sending PING packets
once in a while.

The code may be used as a template for building other HTTP3
clients.

Requirements:
- OpenSSL with QUIC      https://github.com/quictls/openssl
- ngtcp2 with OpenSSL    https://github.com/ngtcp2/ngtcp2
- nghttp3                https://github.com/ngtcp2/nghttp3
- libevent

Build:
- ./compile.sh

Run client:
- ./main
